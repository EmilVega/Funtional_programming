For the second question: onKeys and pressedKeys are not used in this game. It's just that I developed Input.hs for a previous game, and used the same Input.hs for this Minesweeper game.

For the first question:
drawTexture takes 4 arguments:

1) source position (u,v). These are the position of the part, within a source image, that we want to draw.
2) source size (uw,vh). These are the size of the part, within a source image, that we want to draw.
3) destination position (x,y). These are the position, on the screen, where we want to draw.
4) destination size (w,h). These are the size, on the screen, to draw.

The four lines:
        tex (u)      (v - vh) >> ver (x)     (y - h)
        tex (u + uw) (v - vh) >> ver (x + w) (y - h)
        tex (u + uw) (v)      >> ver (x + w) (y)    
        tex (u)      (v)      >> ver (x)     (y)
tell OpenGL the source (tex) and destination (ver) of four positions to draw from/to.

so, "tex 0 0 >> ver 1 1" for instance would tell OpenGL to draw the pixel at position 0 0 in the source texture, at the position 1 1 on the screen.

So, these four lines of code specify 4 positions to draw from and draw to (and then OpenGL takes all the pixels inside the square/rectangle/polygon defined by these 4 positions and draws them to).

To give one more example,
tex (0/8) (0/8) >> ver (7/8) (7/8)
tex (0/8) (1/8) >> ver (7/8) (8/8)
tex (1/8) (0/8) >> ver (8/8) (7/8)
tex (1/8) (1/8) >> ver (8/8) (8/8)
would draw the square between 0/8, 0/8, 1/8 and 1/8 on a source image, at the square 7/8, 7/8,
7/8, 7/8, 8/8 and 8/8 on the screen.
